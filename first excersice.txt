Ticket 1: Add a custom id field for Agents in the Facilities table

Description: Currently, Agents' ids on reports are their internal database ids. This ticket requires adding a custom id field for each Agent in the Facilities table.

Acceptance criteria:

A new column "custom_id" is added to the Facilities table.
The custom_id field can be updated for each Agent in the Facilities table.
When generating reports, the custom_id field is used instead of the internal database id.
Time/effort estimate:

Development time: 2-4 hours
Testing time: 1-2 hours
Implementation details:

Add a new column "custom_id" to the Facilities table using a database migration script.
Modify the Agent object in the code to include the custom_id field.
Modify the getShiftsByFacility function to return the custom_id for each Agent.
Modify the generateReport function to use the custom_id field instead of the internal database id.
Ticket 2: Add a custom id field for Agents in the Shifts table

Description: Currently, the Shifts table only has a reference to the Agent's internal database id. This ticket requires adding a custom_id field for each Agent in the Shifts table.

Acceptance criteria:

A new column "custom_id" is added to the Shifts table.
When creating a new Shift, the custom_id field can be populated with the custom_id of the Agent.
When retrieving Shifts, the custom_id field is returned instead of the internal database id.
Time/effort estimate:

Development time: 2-4 hours
Testing time: 1-2 hours
Implementation details:

Add a new column "custom_id" to the Shifts table using a database migration script.
Modify the createShift function to allow passing in the custom_id of the Agent.
Modify the getShiftsByFacility function to return the custom_id for each Agent.
Ticket 3: Update report generation to use custom_id instead of internal database id

Description: Currently, the report generation function uses the internal database id to identify Agents. This ticket requires updating the function to use the custom_id field instead.

Acceptance criteria:

The generateReport function uses the custom_id field instead of the internal database id.
Reports generated using the updated function correctly display the custom_id for each Agent.
Time/effort estimate:

Development time: 1-2 hours
Testing time: 1-2 hours
Implementation details:

Modify the generateReport function to use the custom_id field instead of the internal database id.
Ticket 4 (Optional): Add validation for the custom_id field in the Facilities and Shifts tables

Description: To ensure data consistency, it may be necessary to add validation for the custom_id field in both the Facilities and Shifts tables.

Acceptance criteria:

When creating or updating a Facility or Shift, the custom_id field is validated to ensure it is unique.
When creating or updating a Facility or Shift, the custom_id field is validated to ensure it is not null or empty.
Time/effort estimate:

Development time: 2-4 hours
Testing time: 1-2 hours
Implementation details:

Add validation rules to the database schema for the custom_id field.
Modify the create/update functions to check for validation errors and throw exceptions if necessary.
Note: Ticket 4 may not be necessary depending on the existing validation in the codebase and the project's specific requirements.
